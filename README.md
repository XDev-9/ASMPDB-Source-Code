Don't expect the code provided to be any good if you're thinking of using some parts for your bot.
The code I wrote is really just practice for me.

That said, if you want to just copy and paste what I've uploaded, make sure to create a "token.txt" file in the same folder as the main.py file with the bot token inside, as not doing so will prevent your program from logging into your bot.
Alternatively, you can remove the part that opens the token.txt file and just plug your token in bot.run()
